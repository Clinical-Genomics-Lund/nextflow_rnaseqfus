To get fastq_screen run, we need to have genome data and config file. Using fastq_screen --get-genomes whill download both ref data and config file. 
error: handshake in perl: Perl has to be installed in container and the shebang needs to be set properly!!!

**STARFusion:
Installation and getting the StarFusion sw to run is just a headache, There are so many conflicts between ref data version, dependencies version with other SWs and perl packages installation. 
So, the best option is to use its from the available singularity img. 
Problems are still there; do not forget to give the absulut path of the ctat directory when running the starfusion via nextflow. Otherwise, as nextflow stages 
input file in the a tmp directory, when the starfusion needs to find the "AnnotFilterRule.pm" which locates in ctat_genome_lib_build_dir/. It looks for the fullpath while from the tmp dir it can not be found.
